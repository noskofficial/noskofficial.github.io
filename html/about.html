        <p class="about-content">
            <b>Free Software</b> comes from free software movement started in 1983 by computer scientist <b>Richard M Stallman</b>, when he launched a project called <b>GNU</b> which stands for GNU is Not Unix, to provide a replacement for the <b>UNIX</b> operating system - a replacement that would respect the freedoms of those using it. More precisely, free software means users of a program have the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#four-freedoms">four essential freedoms</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
            <b>Open Source</b> is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Also it doesn't just mean access to source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">given ten criteria</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="about-content">
            The main diffrence between free and open source is that free software is a social movement but the open source is a development pattern.
